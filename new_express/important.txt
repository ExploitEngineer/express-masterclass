1. Introduction to Express.js

Express.js is a minimal & flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by providing a suite of HTTP utility methods and middleware, making it easier to create APIs and handle various web functionalities.

Why use Express.js ?
. Simplicity: Minimalist structure allows for quick setup and development.
. Flexibility: Middleware architecture enables customization and scalability.
. Performance: Built on Node.js, it offers non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
. Community Support: Extensive community & plethora of plugins/middleware.



What is a GET Request ?
A GET request is one of the HTTP methods used by the client (borwser, mobile, app, etc.) to ask the server for data - typically to read or retrieve something (e.g., web page, JSON data, etc.)
It's idempotent, meaning calling it multiple times won't change anything on the server.


Common HTTP Status Codes in Express
✅ 1xx – Informational (Rarely used)
100 Continue
101 Switching Protocols

✅ 2xx – Success
200 OK: Request succeeded (default success)
201 Created: Resource created (e.g. in POST)
204 No Content: Success, but no data returned

⚠️ 3xx – Redirection
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found (Temporary redirect)
304 Not Modified (cache optimization)

❌ 4xx – Client Errors
400 Bad Request: Invalid request data
401 Unauthorized: Login required
403 Forbidden: Not allowed
404 Not Found: Route/resource doesn't exist
409 Conflict: Duplicate data or resource state conflict

💥 5xx – Server Errors
500 Internal Server Error: Something broke
502 Bad Gateway
503 Service Unavailable


What are Query Parameters ?
Query parameters are extra data send by the client in the URL after a ?.
They are usually used to:
. Search/filter Content
. Sort results
. Control pagination (e.g., page 1, limit 10)
. Send not-sensitive info to the server
NOTE:
if query params is missing, its value will be undefined


What is a POST reqeust ?
. POST is an HTTP method used to send data to the server.
. Unlike GET, it doesn't expose data in the URL.
. Used for creating the resources, like new users, posts, comments, etc.


What is PUT request ?
The PUT method is used to fully udpate or replace a resource. It expects all updatable fields to be included in the request. It is idempotent, meaning multiple indentical requests result in the same state.


What is PATCH request ?
The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource. You send only the fields that need to be changed. It is also idempotent in most practical APIs, but updates only what's specified.


What is DELETE method ?
The DELETE HTTP method is used to remove a specific resource from the server, permanently.


What is Middleware in Express ?
A middleware ia function that runs before your route handler (req, res) and has access to: (req, res, next).
Middleware can:
. Modify the request (req)
. Modity the response (res)
. End the request-response cycle
. Call next() to pass control to the next middleware


What is express-validator ?
express-validator is a set of Express.js middlewares that wraps the extensive collection of validators and sanitizers offered by validator.js. It allows you to validate and sanitize incoming request data in a declarative and readable manner.


What are Cookies 🍪 ?
Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the browser of a user.
They are mainly used to:
. Remember users (e.g., keep them looged in)
. Store session info (e.g., items in a cart)
. Track user behaviour (e.g., for analytics or authentication)
They are sent automatically with every request made to the same domain.


Why use Cookies in Express ?
Imagine this:
. A user logs in
. You want to remember this user on every request they make
. You store a cookie in the user's browser with their user ID, token, or session ID.
Then every time they send a request to your server, you can read that cookie to identify who the user is.
No need to keep sending login data everytime.


What is cookie-parser ?
It's a middleware that:
. Parses cookies from the browser
. Makes them avaliable on req.cookies
. Can handle signed cookies for extra security

🧠 9. Summary / Notes for Your Revision
cookie-parser:          Middleware to read cookies
req.cookies:	        Access unsigned cookies
req.signedCookies:  	Access signed cookies
signed: true:       	Protect cookie with secret
httpOnly:           	JS cannot access
secure:             	Only over HTTPS
maxAge:             	Duration for cookie
res.cookie():       	Set cookie
res.clearCookie():     	Remove cookie


What is Mongoose ?
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model your application data.


What use Mongoose ?
. Schema Definition: Define the structure of your documnets.
. Validation: Built-in type casting and validation.
. Middleware: Pre & post hooks for operations.
. Abstraction: Simplifies MongoDB operations.


✨ KEY MONGOOSE TOPICS YOU MUST MASTER
Schema:
    	Defines the structure of documents
Model:
    	Provides methods like .find(), .save(), .create()
save():
    	Saves a new document
find(), findOne():
    	            Retrieve documents
updateOne(), findByIdAndUpdate():
    	                            Update a document
deleteOne(), findByIdAndDelete():
    	                            Remove document
validation:
            Enforce data constraints
middleware:
    	    Pre/post hooks like pre('save')
virtuals:
    	    Fake fields that don't exist in DB but appear in JS
timestamps:
    	    Auto-manage createdAt and updatedAt
populate():
    	    Reference documents from another collection
ref:
    Used in schema for populate() feature
lean():
    	Returns plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose docs

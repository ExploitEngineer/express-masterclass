1. Introduction to Express.js

Express.js is a minimal & flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by providing a suite of HTTP utility methods and middleware, making it easier to create APIs and handle various web functionalities.

Why use Express.js ?
. Simplicity: Minimalist structure allows for quick setup and development.
. Flexibility: Middleware architecture enables customization and scalability.
. Performance: Built on Node.js, it offers non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
. Community Support: Extensive community & plethora of plugins/middleware.



What is a GET Request ?
A GET request is one of the HTTP methods used by the client (borwser, mobile, app, etc.) to ask the server for data - typically to read or retrieve something (e.g., web page, JSON data, etc.)
It's idempotent, meaning calling it multiple times won't change anything on the server.

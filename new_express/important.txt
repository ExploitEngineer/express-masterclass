1. Introduction to Express.js

Express.js is a minimal & flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by providing a suite of HTTP utility methods and middleware, making it easier to create APIs and handle various web functionalities.

Why use Express.js ?
. Simplicity: Minimalist structure allows for quick setup and development.
. Flexibility: Middleware architecture enables customization and scalability.
. Performance: Built on Node.js, it offers non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
. Community Support: Extensive community & plethora of plugins/middleware.



What is a GET Request ?
A GET request is one of the HTTP methods used by the client (borwser, mobile, app, etc.) to ask the server for data - typically to read or retrieve something (e.g., web page, JSON data, etc.)
It's idempotent, meaning calling it multiple times won't change anything on the server.


Common HTTP Status Codes in Express
‚úÖ 1xx ‚Äì Informational (Rarely used)
100 Continue
101 Switching Protocols

‚úÖ 2xx ‚Äì Success
200 OK: Request succeeded (default success)
201 Created: Resource created (e.g. in POST)
204 No Content: Success, but no data returned

‚ö†Ô∏è 3xx ‚Äì Redirection
301 Moved Permanently
302 Found (Temporary redirect)
304 Not Modified (cache optimization)

‚ùå 4xx ‚Äì Client Errors
400 Bad Request: Invalid request data
401 Unauthorized: Login required
403 Forbidden: Not allowed
404 Not Found: Route/resource doesn't exist
409 Conflict: Duplicate data or resource state conflict

üí• 5xx ‚Äì Server Errors
500 Internal Server Error: Something broke
502 Bad Gateway
503 Service Unavailable


What are Query Parameters ?
Query parameters are extra data send by the client in the URL after a ?.
They are usually used to:
. Search/filter Content
. Sort results
. Control pagination (e.g., page 1, limit 10)
. Send not-sensitive info to the server
NOTE:
if query params is missing, its value will be undefined


What is a POST reqeust ?
. POST is an HTTP method used to send data to the server.
. Unlike GET, it doesn't expose data in the URL.
. Used for creating the resources, like new users, posts, comments, etc.


What is PUT request ?
The PUT method is used to fully udpate or replace a resource. It expects all updatable fields to be included in the request. It is idempotent, meaning multiple indentical requests result in the same state.


What is PATCH request ?
The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource. You send only the fields that need to be changed. It is also idempotent in most practical APIs, but updates only what's specified.
